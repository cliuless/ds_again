# Welcome to Week 6: "MLE, GLM & NLP" 

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

We will kick off Week 6 with a discussion of the theory behind MLE and GLM. We will then pivot from Project McNulty to Project Fletcher. Before you can dive into unsupervised learning you will need to get your data! We will dedicate Thursday and Friday for unstructured data acquisition and storage techniques.

#### Technical Focus

We will wrap up classification on Monday & Tuesday with discussions about alternate cost functions and how to generalize our linear models with MLE and GLM. On Wednesday you will present your McNulty projects. We will introduce the fourth project, Fletcher, on Thursday as well as the NoSQL and MongoDB paradigm and how to work with the Twitter API. Lastly, we will master NLP techniques together.
