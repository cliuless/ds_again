#### Pair Question #1

For each question below, say yes, no or somewhat for these classification algorithms: KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes.

    1) Is it interpretable?
    2) Is it inherently multi-class?
    3) Is it scalable with large number of features (in terms of execution time and quality of results)?
    4) Is it scalable with large number of data points (in terms of execution time and quality of results)?
    5) Is it good with diverse (non-homogenous) set of features?

#### Pair Question #2

Do Friday's [pair problem](https://github.com/thisismetis/nyc18_ds14/blob/master/class_lectures/week05-mcnulty2/05-flask/pair_decorators.md) in JavaScript

    1) You can just do ispect on this very webpage and switch to the "Console" tab to write JS
    2) A function is defined as 'function' instead of 'def'. The body of a function is encased inside {}.
    3) In JavaScript a function is just like a variable that can be copied or passed into a function or returned.
