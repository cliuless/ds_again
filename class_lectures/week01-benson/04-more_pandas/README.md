 * You have a write-up about your analysis of MTA turnstile (and/or other) data on your blog, and there's a link to this write-up on the class [Google sheet](placeholder).



### Additional Resources

 * What if I screw up and commit something that I shouldn't have, like a giant data file or some secret info like a password or API key?
     * GitHub on how to [Remove sensitive data](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/) (note that you may want to skip to the section on the BFG)
 * [Numpy array tip sheet](http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~myers/teaching/ComputationalMethods/python/arrays.html), a little old but still pretty good for current `numpy` versions
 * [Useful Pandas Snippets](http://www.swegler.com/becky/blog/2014/08/06/useful-pandas-snippets/)
