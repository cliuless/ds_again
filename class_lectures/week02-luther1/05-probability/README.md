### Further "Reading"

 * [Ten minute video lecture on learning curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4XluwGYPaA): Remember: "High bias" is underfitting, "high variance" is overfitting. Andrew Ng builds intuition in how to use learning curves to understand your model.
 
### What's coming up next week?

 * Again early next week, pretty much as soon as you can, you will try
   to reach a Minimum Viable Product. Something you can present if
   everything came crashing down and suddenly you can't work on it
   anymore. Once you get there, you can expand it, add more analysis,
   improve your answer or answer additional questions.
 * We will have individual (5 min MAX) presentations next Friday morning.
