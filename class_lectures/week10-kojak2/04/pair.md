Let's work with Recurrent Neural Nets & LSTMS :


1) import data via :
from keras.datasets import imdb

2) Build a RNN & LSTM & compare results.
Visualize your training as we did with CNNs.   

3) Develop a CNN+ LSTM model.
[ref](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-long-short-term-memory-networks/)

4) See if you can do anything to improve your models
based on your visuals

* If you have time, experiment with how you would train a model with
variable length sentences.    [hint](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/40)
