# Welcome to Week 5: "Deep-Learning & Data-Products" 

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

In Week 5 we'll wrap up our Classification Series with Naive Bayes & an intro to Deep Learning.  We will then embark upon our tour of Data Products.


#### Technical Focus

As you continue to develop your McNulty masterpieces, you will learn how to work with some amazing tools this week that you can leverage for your projects.  On Monday we will cover the Naive Bayes algorithm as well as quiz results (and open questions) from last week's quiz.  On Tuesday we'll move on to Stochastic Gradient Descent and an introduction to Deep Learning.   The rest of the week will be devoted to data products including: HTML, CSS, Javascript, D3 and flask
