#### Pair Problem


#1) Make sure to do the Docker install first :) (See Pre-Class link!) 

#2)
Generate the numbers 1 to 100.

Do the following first by list comprehension and then do it again by using `map` and `filter`:

 * Square the numbers.
 * Select just the squares that are odd.

What does `reduce` do? Use it to do the following:

 * Add up the numbers 1 to 100.
