#### Pair Problem

**Write a program that will play tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.**

This is a challenging problem. Maybe two people on a team can work on the data structure and implementation while the others can work on the heuristics.

Your program doesn't have to perfect. Start with something as simple as random, then maybe build a program that wouldn't blatantly lose. And then go for the win. Have fun with it.

The output can be just a print of the 3x3 board. Remember, to clear the output you can use this:

    from IPython import display
    display.clear_output(wait=True)

And to get the user input, you can use:

    raw_input()
